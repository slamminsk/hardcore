Wish you were here,
Me oh my countryman,
Wish you where here,

Wish you were here,
Don't you know the stove is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I'm feeling blue.

Wish you were here,
Me oh my countryman,
Wish you where here,

Wish you were here,
Don't you know the stove is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I'm feeling blue…

I've got feelings for you, baby,
Do you still feel the same?
From the first time I laid my eyes on you,
I felt joy of living,
I saw heaven in your eyes,
In your eyes…

Wish you were here,
Me oh my countryman,
Wish you where here,

Wish you were here,
Don't you know the stove is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I'm feeling blue…

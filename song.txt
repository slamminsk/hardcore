Wish you were here,
Me oh my countryman,
Wish you where here,

Wish you were here,
Don't you know the stove is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I'm feeling blue.

Wish you were here,
Me oh my countryman,
Wish you where here,

Wish you were here,
Don't you know the stove is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I'm feeling blue…

I've got feelings for you, baby,
Do you still feel the same?
From the first time I laid my eyes on you,
I felt joy of living,
I saw heaven in your eyes,
In your eyes…

Wish you were here,
Me oh my countryman,
Wish you where here,

Wish you were here,
Don't you know the stove is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I'm feeling blue…

I miss your laugh,
I miss your smile,
I miss everything about you,
Every second's like a minute,
Every minute's like a day,
When you're far away!

Wish you were here,
The stove is getting colder, baby,
Wish you were here,
A battlefield of love and fear…
And wish you were here…

I've got feelings for you, baby,
From the first time I laid my eyes on you.
